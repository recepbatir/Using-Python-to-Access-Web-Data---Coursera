"""
CALLING A JSON API
In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to 
http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/geojson.py. The program will prompt for a location,
contact a web service and retrieve JSON for the web service and parse that data,
and retrieve the first place_id from the JSON. A place ID is a textual identifier
that uniquely identifies a place as within Google Maps.


API ENDPOINTS
To complete this assignment, you should use this API endpoint that has a static
subset of the Google Data:

http://python-data.dr-chuck.net/geojson

This API uses the same parameters (sensor and address) as the Google API. This 
API also has no rate limit so you can test as often as you like. If you visit 
the URL with no parameters, you get a list of all of the address values which 
can be used with this API.

To call the API, you need to provide a sensor=false parameter and the address 
that you are requesting as the address= parameter that is properly URL encoded
using the urllib.urlencode() fuction as shown in 
http://www.pythonlearn.com/code/geojson.py


TEST DATA / SAMPLE EXECUTION
You can test to see if your program is working with a location of "South Federal
University" which will have a place_id of "ChIJJ8oO7_B_bIcR2AlhC8nKlok".


TURN IN
Please run your program to find the place_id for this location: Columbia 
University

Make sure to enter the name and case exactly as above and enter the place_id and
your Python code below. Hint: The first seven characters of the place_id are 
"ChIJdeM ...". Make sure to retreive the data from the URL specified above and 
not the normal Google API. Your program should work with the Google API - but the
place_id may not match for this assignment.
